Brother to the higher contrast [newbound light](https://atom.io/themes/newbound-light-syntax), **newbound dark** is a theme for [Atom](https://atom.io), based on the hues and shades from [Oliver Pattison’s website](https://olivermak.es). Optimized for writing Markdown and front-end development, it should also work for general use.

- Subtle `invisibles` (if enabled in Settings)
- Suitable for monospace fonts without an italic variant

## Specific support for these syntaxes

General support for other languages is intended but not guaranteed.
